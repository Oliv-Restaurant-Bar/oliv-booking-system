# Code Review Guidelines

## Always check
- New API endpoints have corresponding integration tests
- Database migrations are backward-compatible
- Error messages don't leak internal details to users

## Style
- Prefer `match` statements over chained `isinstance` checks
- Use structured logging, not f-string interpolation in log calls

## Skip
- Formatting-only changes in `*.lock` files
